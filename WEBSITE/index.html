          Nandi Hills, or Nandidurg, is a hill fortress in the south Indian
          state of Karnataka. Tipu Sultan Fort, a summer retreat of the namesake
          18th-century ruler, features stone carvings and wall paintings.
          Prisoners are said to have been thrown to their death from Tipuâ€™s
          Drop, now known for its panoramic views. Local Hindu temples include
          the hilltop Yoga Nandeeshwara Temple, guarded by a huge statue of a
          bull (nandi)
